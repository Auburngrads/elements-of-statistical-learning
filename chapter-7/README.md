## Code implementations

* [Recreating Figure 7.1](https://github.com/alanjeffares/elements-of-statistical-learning/blob/master/chapter-7/code/figure_7.1.R) - Generating a synthetic dataset with 35 variables then modelling using LAR with the lasso modification. 100 train and test sets are generated with the error of each plotted along with their averages.

* [Recreating Figure 7.4](https://github.com/alanjeffares/elements-of-statistical-learning/blob/master/chapter-7/code/figure_7.4.R) - This plot examines the performance of AIC for estimating optimal complexity for logistic regression with both log-likelihood and 0-1 loss on the phoneme dataset. The AIC calculation doesn't strictly apply here and the actual optimism from Efron (1986) is included in the bottom of this script.
