# The Elements of Statistical Learning 

This repository documents my progress as I work through [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani, and J. Friedman. I include my solutions to the exercises in each chapter as well as my own additional derivations and R implementations of some of the sections that I have found particularly interesting and/or tricky along the way. Click on any of the links below to see a more detailed description of my workings for each chapter. If you notice any errors or have a question please feel free to raise an issue.
